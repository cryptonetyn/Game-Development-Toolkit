# Game Development Toolkit

A lightweight JavaScript package for creating and managing browser-based games.

## Installation

You can install the package via npm:

\```bash
npm install game-development-toolkit
\```

## Usage

First, import the `Game` class from the package:

\```javascript
const Game = require('game-development-toolkit');
\```

Then, create a new instance of the `Game` class with the desired width and height:

\```javascript
const game = new Game(800, 600);
\```

Next, define and add entities to the game. For example:

\```javascript
// Define a player entity
class Player extends Entity {
  constructor(x, y) {
    super(x, y);
    this.speed = 5;
  }

  // Override the update method for player-specific logic
  update() {
    // Player update logic goes here
  }
}

// Create a new player entity and add it to the game
const player = new Player(100, 100);
game.addEntity(player);
\```

Finally, start the game loop to update and render the game:

\```javascript
// Update and render the game loop
function gameLoop() {
  game.update();
  game.render();
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

// Start the game loop
gameLoop();
\```
